I'm a programmer with a focus on backend development, database management, and home automation. I like working on interesting problems and automating things when I get the chance.

- **Database Management**: Making sure databases are optimized and well-managed.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Creating solid integrations between the front and back ends.
- **Home Automation**: Running clusters and automating things at home.

I work on a mix of personal and open-source projects, particularly around backend systems and automation.
